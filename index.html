        <p> People should travel to hell because they deserve it. It has <em> beautiful </em> pools of warm water so you can sit in a spa, it has <strong>fireshows that you wont find <em>anywhere else</em></strong>. And the <strong>complimentary</strong> smell of brimstone and sulfur <em> really </em> brings it all together.</p>
        <p> <strong>why is heavan not where you wanna go? </strong> heaven <em>stinks</em> because they have all the preppy stuff. thats it thats my point about heaven.</p>
